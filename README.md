# PRODIGY_CS_02
PROJECT:develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation you can perform operations like swapping,pixerl values or applying a basic mathematical operations to each pixel allow user to encrypt and decrypt images
Image Encryption and Decryption Program
This program is designed to encrypt and decrypt images using the Pillow library in Python. It swaps the red and blue color channels of the image, effectively encrypting the image. The decryption process reverses this operation to restore the original image.
Note
The key parameter in both functions is currently set to None, which means the program will encrypt and decrypt the image without any additional encryption. You can modify this to use a custom encryption key if needed.
This program is a basic example of image encryption and decryption.
